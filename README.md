# Minesweeper clones
In the src/ folder, you may find two versions of my Minesweeper clones.

## Fortyniner
Fortyniner is a truely feature-wise clone of Minesweeper. It is more complex and it offers more scalability compared to the other project.

It was developed prior to the other project and it is superior!
## Minesweeper
Minesweeper was developed after Fortyniner to comply with evaluation form completely (like developing the whole game in a single .java file).

It is more barebones but still has the robust random mine placer algorithm and has its own taste -> instead of mines, it offers you, a civilan, to survive a fallen land of yours thanks to Jitler. Your objective is to discover the safe zones.

## com.gokdenizozkan.util
This package has my own methods I developed throughout my patika+ programme to date.

They all are written for the sake of solving problems or DRY. The method I love most is the ask() method found in the Input class.

ask() method allows one to
- ask a question
- provide options
- and have a return value in the type of your provided option in a very convenient way!

### Have fun!
